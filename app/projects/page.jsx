        <h3>Coding with kids</h3>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm passionate about teaching kids to wield technology and giving them those ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments.
        </p>
        <h4>In the classroom</h4>
        <p>
          For several years I‚Äôve taught coding enrichments at <a
          href="https://www.discoveryk8.org/">Discovery Charter School‚Äôs</a> Falcon Campus using
          code.org and Scratch, giving each child in the class hands-on time with the tools and
          individual guidance.
        </p>
        <h4>Toy projects</h4>
        <p>
          I‚Äôve built some little projects with my kids using Scratch, finding creative ways to deal
          with its limitations and demonstrate programming concepts.
